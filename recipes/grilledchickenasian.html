        <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
        <p>This Asian chicken recipe is great for last-minute company or a quick dinner by rounding it out with a baked potato and tossed salad.</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Â¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>3 slices fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger in a small microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave on medium power for 1 minute, then stir. Heat again for 30 seconds, watching closely to prevent boiling.</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish. Pour soy sauce mixture over top and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, remove chicken from marinade; transfer marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thick, about 1 minute. Set aside for basting.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill, basting frequently with reserved marinade, until golden brown on all sides and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest piece should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
